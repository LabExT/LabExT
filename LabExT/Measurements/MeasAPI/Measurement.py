class Measurement:
    """Super class for measurement algorithms for LabExT.

    Aside from being an "interface" for measurement algorithm code, this class offers some basic functionality for
    executing measurements. It holds the currently set measurement parameters and the selected instruments (description
    and pointers to driver instances).

    To get a running measurement, change the properties: `name` and `settings_path`. You need to specify the requested
    instrument types in `get_wanted_instrument` and a set of default parameters in `get_default_parameter`.
    The measurement algorithm needs to be implemented in the `algorithm` method. See their respective reference below.
    For a How-To on implementing a new measurement algorithm, see
    [the New Measurement Algorithm page](./code_new_meas_example.md).

    Attributes:
        check_param (str): Class attribute. Will affect what the measure function does on missing
            parameters: `'Raise'` Raises an exception, `'Debug'` Generates a log entry (This will most likely lead to an
            exception in the algorithm),  `'Auto'` Fills the missing parameter with its default value.
        check_instr (str): Class attribute. Will affect what the measure function does on missing instruments:
            `'Raise'` Raises and exception, `'Debug'` Generates a log entry (This will most likely lead to an exception
            in the algorithm), `'Ignore'` Do Nothing
        name (str): Name of the measurement, typically similar of equal to the class name.
        settings_path (str): File name of the settings file of this measurement, can be anything and should end in
            '.json'.
        selected_instruments (dict): Set by the LabExT GUI after instrument selection stage. Keys is an instrument type,
            values is one instrument description dictionary from instruments.config (i.e. a VISA address, a driver
            class name, channel information and optionally some more constructor arguments for the driver).
