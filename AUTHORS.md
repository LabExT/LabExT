LabExT is written in part by tireless folks at the
[Institute of Electromagnetic Fields, ETH Zurich, Switzerland](https://ief.ee.ethz.ch) as part of their daily grind in
an RF and optics laboratory. Another big part is written by [Polariton Technologies AG](https://www.polariton.ch/) whose support and experience in
integrated optics design and the testing thereof we gratefully acknowledge.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS - people who have submitted measurements and
instrument drivers, reported bugs, helped answer newbie questions, and generally made LabExT that much better:

* Andreas Messner
* Boris Vukovic <vukovicb@ethz.ch>
* David Moor
* Dominik Werner
* Etienne Corminboeuf
* Guy L체thi
* Hendrik Z체llig
* Imre Kertesz
* Laurenz Kulmer
* Malte W채chter <hello@malte-waechter.com>
* Marco Eppenberger <mail@mebg.ch>
* Nino Del Medico <nino@polariton.ch>
* Pascal Sch채rli
